<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

- Used Solidity Smart Contract for DApp transactions on ETH. Once user logged into metamask they can view all transactions made on website. 
- Utilized GIPHY-API for sending a gif with each transaction based on keyword/s provided by user. Transaction processed included amount of ETH, personal message, timestamp, and custom gif from API.

Next Features Include

1- Exploring Seven Layer Trust Protocol - Security is at the forefront in terms of application success, and I want to provide that.
2- Real Time Analysis of Crypto Market - Using data Analytics tools, API's, etc. I will have real time stock analysis of the crypto market.
3- Expand Navigation - Navigation is currently disable as sole focus was first to send ETH transactions with GIPHY-API.
